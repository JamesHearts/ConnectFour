# Space Connect Four
C based Game

This game was inspired by the original connect four. The twist on this game is that it is being played in an environment where gravity is non-existent. 

Players can choose to enter a piece from 4 corners of the connect four board. The players choose how much force they want to use when inserting a piece. The force dictates how far a piece will move into the board. Pieces with a strong enough force will displace other pieces, however pieces will cannot be forced out of the board.

The object of the game is that of the original connect four, connect four pieces in a row to win.
